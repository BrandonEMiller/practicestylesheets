stylesheets
===========

A basic css style sheet Resitancss is futile

This was our second project at The Iron Yard Academy, a practice in making a style sheet that we could refer back to. 

This style sheet was created for this assignment and has not been updated to maintain styles I currrently use.  

It is very rough as I was still starting out and will be something I will be updating upon completion of my time at the Iron Yard
